## Introduction

[DrugBank](https://www.drugbank.ca/) database is a comprehensive, freely
accessible, online database containing information on drugs and drug
targets. As both a bioinformatics and a cheminformatics resource,
DrugBank combines detailed drug (i.e.¬†chemical, pharmacological and
pharmaceutical) data with comprehensive drug target (i.e.¬†sequence,
structure, and pathway) information. More information about DrugBank can
be found [here](https://www.drugbank.ca/about).

In its raw form, the DrugBank database is a single
XML file. Users must create an [account](https://www.drugbank.ca/public_users/sign_up)
with DrugBank and request permission to [download](https://www.drugbank.ca/releases/latest)
the database. Note that this may take a couple of days.

The `dbparser` package parses the DrugBank XML database into `R` tibbles that can be explored and analyzed by the user, check [this tutorial](https://docs.ropensci.org/dbparser/articles/dbparser.html) for more details.

If you are waiting for access to the DrugBank database, or do not intend to do a deep dive with
the data, you may wish to use the `dbdataset`
[package](https://mohammedfcis.github.io/dbdataset/index.html), which contains
the DrugBank database already parsed into `R` tibbles. Note that this is a large package that
exceeds the limit set by CRAN. It is only available on GitHub.

`dbparser` is tested against DrugBank versions *5.1.0* through *5.1.7*
successfully. If you find errors with these versions or any other
version please submit an issue
[here](https://github.com/ropensci/dbparser/issues).
