## Overview
Drugs databases vary too much in their formats and structures which making related 
data analysis not a very easy job and requires a lot of efforts to work on only
two databases together such as [DrugBank](https://go.drugbank.com/) and [KEGG](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/).

Hence, `dbparser` package aims to parse different public drugs databases as [DrugBank](https://go.drugbank.com/) or [KEGG](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/) into
single and unified format R object called `dvobject` (stands for drugverse object).

That should help in:

- working with single data object and not multiple databases in different formats,
- using R analysis capabilities easily on drugs data,
- ease of transferring data between researchers after performing required data
analysis or `dvobject` and storing results in the same object in a very easy manner

### dvobject Structure
`dvobject` introduces a unified and compressed format of drugs data.
It is an R list object that contains one or more of the following sub-lists:

- **drugs**: list of data.frames that contain drugs information (i.e. synonyms, classifications, ...) and it is the only mandatory list
- **salts**: data.frame contains drugs salts information
- **products**: data.frame of commercially available drugs products in the world
- **references**: data.frame of articles, links and textbooks about drugs or CETT data
- **cett**: list of data.frames contain targets, enzymes, carriers and transporters information

## Drug Databases
Parsers are available for the following databases (it is in progress list)

### DrugBank

[DrugBank](https://go.drugbank.com/) database is a comprehensive, freely
accessible, online database containing information on drugs and drug
targets. As both a bioinformatics and a cheminformatics resource,
DrugBank combines detailed drug (i.e.¬†chemical, pharmacological and
pharmaceutical) data with comprehensive drug target (i.e.¬†sequence,
structure, and pathway) information. More information about DrugBank can
be found [here](https://go.drugbank.com/about).

In its raw form, the DrugBank database is a single
XML file. Users must create an [account](https://go.drugbank.com/public_users/sign_up)
with DrugBank and request permission to [download](https://go.drugbank.com/releases/latest)
the database. Note that this may take a couple of days.

The `dbparser` package parses the DrugBank XML database into `R` tibbles that can be explored and analyzed by the user, check [this tutorial](https://docs.ropensci.org/dbparser/articles/dbparser.html) for more details.

If you are waiting for access to the DrugBank database, or do not intend to do a deep dive with
the data, you may wish to use the `dbdataset`
[package](https://interstellar-consultation-services.github.io/dbdataset/), which contains
the DrugBank database already parsed into `dvobject`. Note that this is a large package that
exceeds the limit set by CRAN. It is only available on GitHub.

`dbparser` is tested against DrugBank versions *5.1.0* through *5.1.12*
successfully. If you find errors with these versions or any other
version please submit an issue
[here](https://github.com/ropensci/dbparser/issues).
