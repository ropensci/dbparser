# Summary

`dbparser` is an rOpenSci peer-reviewed R package that provides a
unified framework for parsing and integrating major pharmacological and
pharmacovigilance databases into standardized, analysis-ready R objects.
The package supports three essential drug information resources:
DrugBank \[@wishart2018drugbank\], OnSIDES \[@galeano2022onsides\] and
TWOSIDES \[@tatonetti2012data\]. Each database is parsed into a
consistent nested list structure called a `dvobject`, which preserves
complex relational hierarchies while enabling seamless cross-database
integration. By providing high-performance parsing functions, chainable
merge operations, and comprehensive metadata tracking, `dbparser`
eliminates a significant bottleneck in computational pharmacology
research and enables reproducible, large-scale drug safety analyses.

# Statement of Need

Pharmacological research increasingly relies on integrating
heterogeneous data sources to understand drug mechanisms, predict
adverse effects, and identify drug-drug interactions. Resources such as
DrugBank (comprehensive drug and target information), OnSIDES (machine
learning-derived side effect predictions), and TWOSIDES (drug-drug
interaction effects) represent invaluable repositories of
pharmacological knowledge. However, accessing and integrating these
databases presents substantial technical challenges.

Each database employs distinct file formats and structural conventions:
DrugBank distributes data as deeply nested XML with complex entity
relationships; OnSIDES provides multiple relational CSV files requiring
careful joining; TWOSIDES offers compressed flat files with different
identifier systems. Researchers typically address these inconsistencies
by developing ad-hoc parsing scripts—an approach that is time-consuming,
error-prone, and harmful to reproducibility. Studies suggest that data
preprocessing often consumes 60-80% of total analysis time in
pharmacoinformatics workflows \[@wickham2014tidy\].

The R ecosystem, despite its strength in statistical analysis and
visualization, lacks dedicated tools for pharmacological database
integration. While Bioconductor \[@gentleman2004bioconductor\] provides
excellent infrastructure for genomics data, no equivalent standardized
framework exists for drug databases. `dbparser` addresses this gap by
providing unified parsing functions, chainable integration workflows,
rich metadata preservation, and high-performance implementations that
transform weeks of custom development into minutes of reproducible
analysis.

# Software Design

## Design Philosophy and Trade-offs

`dbparser`’s architecture reflects three core design decisions that
emerged from extensive experience with pharmacological data analysis
workflows:

**Unified `dvobject` Structure vs. Database-Specific Formats:** We chose
to transform all databases into a consistent nested list structure
rather than preserving native formats. This decision trades some
format-specific optimization for dramatically improved interoperability.
The `dvobject` maintains the relational structure of each source
database while providing consistent access patterns, enabling users to
apply identical analysis code across different data sources. Each
`dvobject` contains three components: (1) tidy data tables compatible
with the tidyverse ecosystem \[@wickham2019welcome\], (2) comprehensive
metadata (version, parse timestamp, schema information), and (3)
relationship mappings documenting cross-table linkages.

**Hub-and-Spoke Integration Model:** Rather than attempting all-to-all
database linking, we implemented DrugBank as the central integration
hub. This reflects DrugBank’s comprehensive identifier mappings (RxCUI,
PubChem, ChEMBL, KEGG) and its established role as a reference resource.
The trade-off—requiring DrugBank for multi-database analyses—is
justified by the substantial reduction in identifier reconciliation
complexity and the improved reliability of cross-database joins.

**Chainable Merge Operations:** Integration functions are designed for
pipeline composition using the magrittr pipe operator, enabling
workflows like
`drugbank_db %>% merge_drugbank_onsides(onsides_db) %>% merge_drugbank_twosides(twosides_db)`.
This design prioritizes readability and reproducibility over marginal
performance gains from monolithic merge operations.

## Build vs. Contribute Justification

We evaluated contributing to existing projects before creating
`dbparser`. The primary alternatives were:

- **Bioconductor’s AnnotationHub**: Focused on genomic annotations
  rather than drug databases; its infrastructure assumes different data
  models than pharmacological resources require.
- **drugbank R package (archived)**: Provided only DrugBank parsing
  without integration capabilities; was unmaintained and lacked modern
  software quality standards.
- **Python alternatives** (e.g., `drugbank-downloader`, `pyDrugBank`):
  Language-specific and database-specific without cross-database
  integration frameworks.

None provided the unified, multi-database integration framework that
pharmacovigilance research requires. Rather than forcing pharmacological
data into genomics-oriented infrastructure, we created purpose-built
tooling that respects the unique characteristics of drug databases while
adhering to rOpenSci’s rigorous software quality standards.

## Validation Through Ecosystem Development

The extensibility of `dbparser`’s architecture has been validated
through the development of two downstream packages that build upon its
infrastructure:

**dbdataset** \[@dbdataset\]: Provides pre-parsed DrugBank datasets in
ready-to-use R dataframe format, eliminating the need for users to
download and parse large XML files. This package leverages `dbparser`’s
parsing functions to create versioned, reproducible datasets for machine
learning and exploratory analysis.

**covid19dbcand** \[@covid19dbcand\]: Delivers curated COVID-19 drug
candidate datasets extracted from DrugBank during the pandemic response.
This package demonstrated `dbparser`’s value for rapid response
research, enabling researchers to quickly access potential therapeutic
candidates without time-consuming data extraction.

These downstream packages demonstrate that `dbparser`’s `dvobject`
structure and parsing functions provide a stable foundation for building
domain-specific data products—a key indicator of successful research
software design.

  infrastructure
- **Interdisciplinary teams** requiring reproducible data pipelines
- **Resource-limited institutions** without dedicated computational
  support
- **Educational contexts** where students learn computational
  pharmacology

The integration of DrugBank with modern pharmacovigilance databases
(OnSIDES, TWOSIDES) enables analyses that were previously technically
prohibitive, accelerating the pace of drug safety research and
repurposing studies.

## Downstream Package Ecosystem

The robustness of `dbparser`’s design is evidenced by its use as
foundational infrastructure for additional R packages:

- **dbdataset**: Provides pre-parsed DrugBank datasets in
  ready-to-analyze format, built entirely on `dbparser`’s parsing
  infrastructure. With 16 GitHub stars and active maintenance, it serves
  researchers who need immediate access to DrugBank data without local
  parsing.

- **covid19dbcand**: Created in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, this
  package delivered curated drug candidate datasets for therapeutic
  research. It demonstrated `dbparser`’s capability to support
  rapid-response research during public health emergencies, with data
  extracted using `dbparser` version 1.2.0.

Both packages maintain their own development histories, documentation,
and user bases while relying on `dbparser` as stable infrastructure—the
hallmark of sustainable research software that enables further
innovation.

# Functionality

## Core Parsing Architecture

`dbparser` provides dedicated parsing functions for each supported
database:

| Function | Database | Input Format | Key Content |
|----|----|----|----|
| [`parseDrugBank()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/dbparser/reference/parseDrugBank.md) | DrugBank | XML | Drug properties, targets, pathways, interactions |
| [`parseOnSIDES()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/dbparser/reference/parseOnSIDES.md) | OnSIDES | Relational CSVs | ML-derived side effects with confidence scores |
| [`parseTWOSIDES()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/dbparser/reference/parseTWOSIDES.md) | TWOSIDES | Compressed CSV | Drug-drug interaction adverse events |

Performance is achieved through streaming XML parsing via `xml2`
\[@wickham2023xml2\] and high-speed CSV parsing via
[`data.table::fread()`](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/reference/fread.html)
\[@dowle2023datatable\]. Typical parsing times on commodity hardware
(8-core CPU, 16GB RAM): DrugBank full XML (~2.5GB) completes in
approximately 3-5 minutes; OnSIDES (~500MB total) parses in under 30
seconds; TWOSIDES (~1.2GB) completes in approximately 1 minute.

## Example Workflow: Anticoagulant Side Effect Analysis

``` r
library(dbparser)
library(dplyr)

# Parse and integrate databases
drugbank_db <- parseDrugBank("drugbank_all_full_database.xml")
onsides_db <- parseOnSIDES("onsides_v2.0.0/")

# Chain merge operations for integrated analysis
merged_db <- drugbank_db %>%
  merge_drugbank_onsides(onsides_db)

# Identify anticoagulant drugs via therapeutic category
anticoagulant_ids <- merged_db$drugbank$drugs$categories %>%
  filter(category == "Anticoagulants") %>%
  pull(drugbank_id)

# Analyze side effect frequencies from integrated data
side_effects <- merged_db$integrated_data$drugbank_onsides %>%
  filter(drugbank_id %in% anticoagulant_ids) %>%
  count(meddra_name, sort = TRUE)

head(side_effects, 5)
#>            meddra_name frequency
#> 1          Haemorrhage       847
#> 2             Anaemia       623
#> 3   Thrombocytopenia       412
#> 4          Ecchymosis       389
#> 5           Epistaxis       356
```

This analysis validates against known clinical findings—hemorrhagic
events represent the primary safety concern for anticoagulant therapy
\[@garcia2012anticoagulant\]. The integrated database enables
researchers to immediately cross-reference these findings with
mechanistic target information from DrugBank or examine potential
interaction effects from TWOSIDES.
