## Overview

Drugs databases vary too much in their formats and structures which
making related data analysis not a very easy job and requires a lot of
efforts to work on only two databases together such as
[DrugBank](https://go.drugbank.com/), [OnSIDES](https://onsidesdb.org/),
and [TWOSIDES](https://tatonettilab.org/resources/nsides/).

Hence, `dbparser` package aims to parse different public drugs databases
into a single and unified format R object called `dvobject` (stands for
drugverse object).

With recent updates, `dbparser` has evolved into an **integration
engine**, allowing you to merge mechanistic data (DrugBank) with
real-world phenotypic data (OnSIDES) and drug-drug interaction risks
(TWOSIDES).

That should help in:

- working with single data object and not multiple databases in
  different formats,
- using R analysis capabilities easily on drugs data,
- ease of transferring data between researchers after performing
  required data analysis or `dvobject` and storing results in the same
  object in a very easy manner.

### dvobject Structure

`dvobject` introduces a unified and compressed format of drugs data. It
is an R list object.

**For a single database (e.g., DrugBank):** It contains one or more of
the following sub-lists:

- **drugs**: list of data.frames that contain drugs information
  (i.e. synonyms, classifications, …) and it is the only mandatory list
- **salts**: data.frame contains drugs salts information
- **products**: data.frame of commercially available drugs products in
  the world
- **references**: data.frame of articles, links and textbooks about
  drugs or CETT data
- **cett**: list of data.frames contain targets, enzymes, carriers and
  transporters information

**For a merged database (Integrated Pharmacovigilance):** When databases
are merged using `merge_drugbank_onsides` or `merge_drugbank_twosides`,
the `dvobject` becomes a nested structure containing:

- **drugbank**: The mechanistic hub.
- **onsides**: The side-effect data (from FDA labels).
- **twosides**: The drug-drug interaction data.
- **integrated_data**: Enriched tables that bridge the databases (e.g.,
  linking DrugBank IDs to OnSIDES adverse events).
- **metadata**: Detailed provenance for all contained datasets.

## Drug Databases

Parsers are available for the following databases (it is in progress
list)

### 1. DrugBank

[DrugBank](https://go.drugbank.com/) database is a comprehensive, freely
accessible, online database containing information on drugs and drug
targets. As both a bioinformatics and a cheminformatics resource,
DrugBank combines detailed drug (i.e. chemical, pharmacological and
pharmaceutical) data with comprehensive drug target (i.e. sequence,
structure, and pathway) information. More information about DrugBank can
be found [here](https://go.drugbank.com/about).

In its raw form, the DrugBank database is a single XML file. Users must
create an [account](https://go.drugbank.com/public_users/sign_up) with
DrugBank and request permission to
[download](https://go.drugbank.com/releases/latest) the database. Note
that this may take a couple of days.

The `dbparser` package parses the DrugBank XML database into `R` tibbles
that can be explored and analyzed by the user, check [this
tutorial](https://docs.ropensci.org/dbparser/articles/dbparser.html) for
more details.

If you are waiting for access to the DrugBank database, or do not intend
to do a deep dive with the data, you may wish to use the `dbdataset`
[package](https://interstellar-egypt.github.io/dbdataset/), which
contains the DrugBank database already parsed into `dvobject`. Note that
this is a large package that exceeds the limit set by CRAN. It is only
available on GitHub.

`dbparser` is tested against DrugBank versions *5.1.0* through *5.1.12*
successfully. If you find errors with these versions or any other
version please submit an issue
[here](https://github.com/ropensci/dbparser/issues).

### 2. OnSIDES (The Phenotype)

[OnSIDES](https://onsidesdb.org/) provides adverse drug events extracted
from thousands of FDA drug labels using machine learning. \* **Parser:**
[`parseOnSIDES()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/dbparser/reference/parseOnSIDES.md)
\* **Input:** Directory containing OnSIDES CSV files.

### 3. TWOSIDES (Polypharmacy)

[TWOSIDES](https://tatonettilab.org/resources/nsides/) provides data on
drug-drug interactions and the adverse events that arise when two drugs
are taken together. \* **Parser:**
[`parseTWOSIDES()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/dbparser/reference/parseTWOSIDES.md)
\* **Input:** The `TWOSIDES.csv.gz` file.

## Quick Start: Integration Pipeline

The power of `dbparser` lies in its ability to chain parsers and mergers
together. Here is how you can build a complete pharmacovigilance
dataset:

``` r
library(dbparser)
library(dplyr)

# 1. Parse the raw databases
drugbank_db <- parseDrugBank("data/drugbank.xml")
onsides_db  <- parseOnSIDES("data/onsides/")
twosides_db <- parseTWOSIDES("data/TWOSIDES.csv.gz")

# 2. Build the Integrated Knowledge Graph
#    DrugBank serves as the hub. We chain the merges.
final_db <- drugbank_db %>% 
  merge_drugbank_onsides(onsides_db) %>% 
  merge_drugbank_twosides(twosides_db)

# 3. Analyze Results
#    Example: Accessing the enriched drug-drug interaction table
head(final_db$integrated_data$drug_drug_interactions)
```

For a detailed case study, please refer to the [Integrated
Pharmacovigilance
Vignette](https://docs.ropensci.org/dbparser/articles/drugbank_nside.html).
